## 📂 Project Files & Descriptions

| 🗂 File                     | 📋 Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `arithmetic_operations.py` | Perform basic math operations on two user-provided numbers.                    |
| `savings_calculator.py`    | Calculate monthly savings and projected interest from income/expenses.         |
| `age_calculator.py`        | Determine your age in the year **2050** from your current age.                 |
| `time_conversion.py`       | Convert **2 hours** into seconds — great for unit conversion practice.         |
| `rectangle_area.py`        | Compute the area of a rectangle from length and width.                         |
| `simple_interest.py`       | Use the simple interest formula *(P × R × T) / 100* to calculate interest.     |
